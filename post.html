	<h2><p>Lego mini-figures became even more interesting for collectors in 2010 with the introduction of a separate line of Lego Minifigures - Lego Minifigures.

	In this line, minifigures are released separately from game sets, instead of being packed with bulky sets. This allowed collectors to invest just in figurines, without getting an excess of unwanted Lego bricks (which are difficult to store).</p></h2>

	<div id="footer"><h1>Mini-figure with a lot of influence</h1> 
	<h2>The mini-figure already has a long history and maybe even more in the future. Time does not seem to affect the charm of these classic figurines: even today their charm reaches the children of adults, as before, to the entire Lego community as a whole.

	They're small in stature, but they've had a huge impact on the toy world as a whole (not just designers) and industry action figures over the past 35 years.

	The story continues, and the figurines remain popular and in demand. These are the real collectibles that will be in demand in the future.</h2>
