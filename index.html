	<h2><p>Hello, reader!</p>
		This site is dedicated to <b>Lego Minifigures</b> so I want to tell you as much as possible about this edition</h2>

	<div id="content"> <h1>First edition</h1>
		<h2>Early versions of Lego minifigures - and not figurines at all, in the current sense. They were much more like just Lego building bricks: three unmarked parts stacked on top of each other, in human form. There were no hands.</h2>

		<h2>The company Lego is very advanced at the moment and passing toy shops we can observe new beautiful designers and elaborate figures.</h2>

		<h2>
		<p>The next big change for Lego minifigures came in 1999 with the first licensed LEGO set. The acquisition of the Star Wars license produced the first licensed Lego figure of Luke Skywalker.</p>

		<p>Then the licensed minifigures were still standard yellow. They were like this until 2003, when Lego made changes to the skin tone for its classic figures - a move that some diehard fans of the standard yellow figures still question. Be that as it may, the natural skin tone brought the figures even closer to the real appearance of the characters and made them more cute.</p>

		<p>In the 2000s, a flurry of changes and innovations in the Lego minifigure series followed. Minifigures with shorter legs, electric parts, sculptural heads appeared, and many different new parts appeared, and all of them began to find their way into LEGO sets. Most of these changes have brought the minifigures to a more interactive and visually dynamic look to keep up with other toys. Lego minifigures have even entered digital reality in TV shows and video games.</p>
